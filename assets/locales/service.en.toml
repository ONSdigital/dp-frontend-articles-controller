# Notes
# - Documentation: https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n/blob/master/README.md
# - Description should be the English version of the text, unless English version is a shorthand e.g. Home button is shorthand in English for Homepage
# - Arguments can be added via {{.argN}} where N is integer index starting at 0 e.g. {{.arg0}} {{.arg1}}
# - To inject HTML (Avoid where possible as it is messy) use "| safeHTML" e.g. {{ localise Foo .Language 1 | safeHTML }} where Foo might be "<strong>test</strong>"
# count - 0 = zero
# count - 1 = one
# count - 2 = two; useful for languages with mutations like welsh (radical) 'brother'=brawd, two (soft) 'brothers'=frawd, three or more (nasal) 'brothers'=brodyr
# count - 3 = few
# count - 6 = many
# count - 4 = other; 4,5 & >6
# Plural rules can be found here: http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html
